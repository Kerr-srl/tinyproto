# Tiny Protocol

Tiny Microcontroller Communication Protocol.


1. Introduction

This protocol is intended to be used in low-memory systems, like
microcontrollers (Stellaris, Arduino). It is also can be compiled
for desktop Linux systems, and it is possible to build it for
Windows. All you need is to implement callback for writing and
reading bytes from physical or logical line.
